	-Good source of fairy pieces too

To Do
-Rook
	-Castling
-Check & checkmate detection
-50/75 Move Rule
-3/5 fold repetition


Tests
- Queens
- Castling tests
	-Plus I wouldn't be surprised if I broke the regular rook tests

Once all of that is finished, then the basic engine will be working
	-Write some board level tests for move correctness
	-Then either get into optimization (magic bit boards, etc)
	-Or start working on the AI

Big List of Ideas
-Sound on movement
-Non-symmetrical pieces, so you can tell king's rook from queen's rook

Players
-Each player has a color for pieces, light squares, and black squares.
